# two-armed-bandit-task



This is an experimental protcol designed within the Sabtini lab of a freely-moving two-armed-bandit task. These files will allow you to build the behavioral arena and begin running 2ABT in mice. 

Laser cutting plans to build the behavioral arena as well as 3D-printing files are located within the "laser cutter" folder. 
Printed Circuit Board (PCB) plans and code is available under the "Two-Armed-Bandit-PCB" repo forked from the Harvard Medical School Insrumentation Core https://github.com/bernardosabatinilab/Two-Armed-Bandit-PCB.
Aquisiton code to control the behavioral arena can be found in the "Mouse-Bandit-Behavior-markov" folder.


Please read "2ABT protocol" for details on behavioral training, learning criterion, and trouble shooting tips.

MATLAB and Arduino IDE is required.
